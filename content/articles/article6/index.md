        - Answer: 
            - All code written in a smart contract will increase the size of your compiled WASM file, and thus will effect the amount of storage you will need when you deploy that contract.

#### Want to read whitepapers and docs faster with better comprehension? üßê

- try reading alot with text to voice feature on your browser set as fast as you can comfortably listen.
- You will get a visual and audible memory of the information and it makes it easier to stay focused.

##### * Recommendations     
   - I recommend turning it off for code blocks, charts and when it is lots of long numbers.
   - Microsoft Edge is the easiest to use. Just right click at the start of the text and then click `Read out loud`. 
- In Edge the voice Elvira sounds the most natural of the bunch.
