- How to use RPC endpoints to monitor multiple accounts? 
#### Answer:
-The NEAR Indexer Framework allows for streams to be captured and indexed in a customized manner. The typical use-case is for this data to make its way to a relational database.

#### Answer:
- Yes, It is part of the near-evm package. 
    - You can see an example of it in use here. https://github.com/near/near-evm/blob/4a791b9e9ae80bfc1ef54b1c90028f20f98132e9/tests/contracts/StandardPrecompiles.sol

- How can I find my newly deployed tokens? (From example https://github.com/near-examples/FT) fungible_token.wasm was deployed. 
#### Solution:
- you can view the current ft balance of an account by using: 
    ```bash
    near view $ID ft_balance_of '{"account_id": "'bob.$ID'"}' `
- you can transfer tokens to different accounts via: 
    ``` bash
    near call $ID ft_transfer '{"receiver_id": "'bob.$ID'", "amount": "19"}' --accountId $ID --amount 0.000000000000000000000001```
- and then check the balances of the accounts.
    - if still are unable to locate tokens contact wallet support.

:::



## Highlights

A few links taken out of context from Monday's office hours. Most have to do with finding the most current tutorials. 

- suggested tutorials (up to spec token contracts)
    - https://github.com/Learn-NEAR/NCD-04--art-demo
    - https://examples.near.org/
- Delete an account and set another account as beneficiary of unused coin from deleted account
    - https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli#near-delete
    - Interested in validation and staking and all that jazz? 
        - [Shards Aliance Discord](discord://discordapp.gg/ZaHCrrG7)
        - https://github.com/near/core-contracts/blob/master/staking-pool/src/lib.rs#L429-L435
        - 
- Running a validator node on mainnet. Unable to withdraw staking funds
  - User thought they were essentially paying for validator seat
  - In reality they were attaching a reserve amount to pay for contract storage of the staking pool they created, which is standard when creating a staking pool.
    - These staking pools are trustless by design, meaning once they are created, no one "owns" them.
    - Attempts to delete the staking pool will throw an error that the contract is holding "too much state".
    - The validator will only be able to withdraw rewards from the staking pool.  
    - Becoming a validator costs roughly 3.5M NEAR.
        - You can raise that amount by convincing others to delegate NEAR to your staking pool.
    - !!!ALWAYS TEST YOUR VALIDATOR STRUCTURE ON TESTNET FIRST!!!

***

## Takeaways
- Multiple GAS issues. What additional information should Gas panic messages have? 
- DevRel Office Hours continues to be a great way to connect NEAR members with the community.
- Always test on testnet first, especially if you are diving into validation, delegating, and staking. Make your mistakes with testnet not real $NEAR!
- The docs are a great resource that update frequently. It's worth subscribing to the repo so you're updated when they are. [docs repo](https://github.com/near/docs)
